HW #7: Documentation

http://xaos.sourceforge.net/doc-trunk/

This is the user manual for XaoS, which is the fractal generation software that I am contributing to for the project.
The documentation is clear and well written, and was generated using Sphinx, an auto-documentation generator for python, similar to doxygen. However, te documentation provides much more than just API descriptions, and fully covers usage and support for the software.
