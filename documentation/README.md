NE 24 -- Number of Jelly Beans Estimator and Multilevel Solvers
===============================================================

This directory contains files from a documentation lesson for NE 24,
Putting the Science in Computational Science, originally taught in
Spring 2015.

Forked from Rachel Slaybaugh of UC Berkeley, edited by Kyle Bystrom.

The file contains two Python programs, EstNumJellies.py and multilevel_solver.py.
*multilevel_solver.py solves multiple levels and performs other nuclear engineering
calculations that freshmen in college are not fully qualified to describe.
*EstNumJellies.py uses breakthrough technology in sociology, mathematics, and
economics to estimate the number of jelly beans in the world, and is currently
being used by medical scientists to predict the spread of Type II diabetes throughout
the world.

Both are documented using doxygen.
