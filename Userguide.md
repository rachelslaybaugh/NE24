Assignment #7 | Rani Mavram
=====

The user/developer guide I found was [NumPy User Guide] (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.9.3/user/index.html)


This guide was helpful because it discussed the variety of scientific and mathemtical Python-based packages that I will need to use for my final project since I will be using arrays and large numbers of data as well.
