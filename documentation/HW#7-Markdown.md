### Link to user guide example
* https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/

* I find this user guide very useful because it is very UI friendly and simple. When you go to the table of contents, you see succint titles which make it easy to find an exact part of the user guide you are looking for. The user guide also provides a myriad of examples which can be very helpful for novice users.
