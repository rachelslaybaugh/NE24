Assignment #7: Documentation
Anais Addad

link to an example of a user or developer guide that you've found:
http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/

This user guide is useful because it helps determine how to read the Numpy library, how to add to it, what format is used, etc. It also determines how the code should be written and gives a lot of different guidelines.
