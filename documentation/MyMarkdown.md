that you've found
This guide is very comprehensive. It walks you throw installation and gives an overview of what the program may be used for. But, 
in my opinion, the most useful feature of this user guide is that it gives very basic examples for you to test the code. Why?
Because, speaking from past experience, I have tried to use many functions in matlab, but have been unable to for various reasons.
If there were a user guide (like the one I have linked to), I probably would have figured out how to use the code.
