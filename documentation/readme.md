## Documentation: About This Folder

This folder contains the files used in the lesson Professor Slaybaugh gives on documentation in coding for her NE24 Freshman Seminar.
There are several files that inform her lesson, and a few files of code that she uses as examples and as part of the homework assignment 
for this unit.

**Lesson Files**

The documentation lesson is saved as both a markdown file and an .ipynb file. Both are titled "documentation.[appropriate file ending]".

**Example Codes**

multilevel_solver.py encodes some mathy goodness that involves a grid and I don't know what else because I didn't look too carefully.
EstNumJellies.py encodes the variables and functions needed to estimate the number of jelly beans produced in the world.
ExampleJellyInput.py has some example inputs for running the Jelly Bean Estimator in the EstNumJellies file.
These files have been included in past homework assignments for the class.

There are two files that describe the Doxygen settings for both the multilevel_solver and EstNumJellies projects. They are named 
ML-doc-example and JB-doc-example respectively.
