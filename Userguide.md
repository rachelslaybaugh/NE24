Assignment #7 | Rani Mavram
=====

The user/developer guide I found was [SciPy User Guide] (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/)


This guide was helpful because it discussed the variety of scientific and mathemtical Python-based packages that I will need to use for my final project since I will be using arrays and large numbers of data as well.
