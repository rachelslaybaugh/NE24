For this assignment I read through the user guide for CodeIgniter, a "toolkit" for people building web applications using PHP.
The guide can be found here: https://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/index.html

I didn't get to read through all that much of the user guide, but that which I did read seemed very clearly explained. It did seem like it was written for people who have a decent amount of knowledge about PHP and building wep apps with it, but I don't think that that is
unreasonable. The introductory material made enough sense to me not to cause any internal alarm, and since I really know nothing about PHP or web applications, I felt that their ability to explain themselves on such a basic level was a credit to the value of their user guide. Looking through some of the basic tutorials included in the guide, it seems to me that the devlopers of CodeIgniter have taken care in their user guide to make it as easy as they could for their customers to use their software. The table of contents is also very useful and the introduction even includes instructions as to how to make use of the user guide to minimize any misunderstandings or difficulties. I guess what I'm saying is that from what little I read of the guide, it seemed like a helpful resource for using CodeIgnit-er's product.
