* [pymatgen usage page](http://pymatgen.org/usage.html#structures-and-molecules)
* pymatgen appears to currently still be developing too quickly to write a full
blown user guide, but their current usage page serves as a an effective intermediate
user guide until the code becomes more stable. It may be difficult for novices to
learn how to use pymatgen from the usage page, but it does provide some descriptions
of the science behind the calculations for more advanced user and contains clear
examples of different uses of the package, which can help users with a basic background
in DFT and first principles calculations science get started quickly.
