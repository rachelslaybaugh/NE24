I found this page to be very informative, and also very well layed out. It had everything from
beginner's coding instructions to discussions that one could join to get more information, to
more complex jobs that they had links to. It does a very good job of really explaining what VLC
is, and how one can contribute to the code. It is not a guide in the sense that it is in a pdf,
but it does exactly the same job, in what I would consider a very well thoughtout way. It doesn't
just throw you in with nothing, it provides many resources to help you contribute to the source 
code, which they also provide. This Developer's Corner is also linked to other pages they have that
contain things like User guides and other comprehensive tools that can help you.
