Brighton Skeel
Assignment #7

A [link](http://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/macros/generic/chemfig/chemfig-en.pdf) to the documentation I've selected. It details the ChemFig package for LaTeX. It has helped me learn to use the package, since I cannot afford the fully fledged ChemDraw software used on a lab scale. Maybe someday I'll be able to use it, but for now, I'm thankful to have the ChemFig package, particularly because it is so well documented (I was able to learn to use the apckage reasonably well simply by reading the documentation).
