\section{Comments of Chosen Documentation}
Having looked through multiple projects and their documentations while looking for a subject for project, SciPy's developer guide is comparatively simpler and more beginner-friendly. They're very clear on their requirements and standards for contributed scipy modules and provide a good amount of resources on SciPy development.
