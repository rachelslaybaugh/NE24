#Documentation

## What's in this directory?
---------------------
### Documentation Lesson

The lesson plan on documentation can be found in two formats, as a markdown file (documentation.md) or as an iPython notebook (documentation.ipynb). For those who do not yet have iPython installed, reading the markdown file is recommended.

### Example Code

The Python files all contain good examples of code comments and other in-code documentation. These are the files that contain the extension .py

### doc_example

This is the file that doxygen uses when creating documentation output. In it are various preferences that can be set for the output. Currently it contains the settings for EstNumJellies.py

### user_guides.txt

The assignment I'm submitting for this particular lesson. It contains a link to a user guide on the Beamer class for LaTeX and a few of my thoughts on it.

### README.md
