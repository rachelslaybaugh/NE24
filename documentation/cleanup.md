A cool [user guide](http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/support/userdocuments.shtml)

* I think this is a very useful guide. While the vocabulary may be above my current understnading, I think
that the use of differenet, specific guides is a very good decision which makes a good effort of matching 
the person with the correct guide. While this does not work perfeclty, it's a very good start at keeping
readers in their comfort zone.
